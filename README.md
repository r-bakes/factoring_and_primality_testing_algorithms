# Factoring and Primality Testing | Quadratic Sieve Implementation

C++ Implementation of the quadratic sieve--a final project for my undergraduate factoring and primality testing at Penn State. 
Utilizes several factoring and primality related algorithms to produce its output such as the strong psudoprime test.
